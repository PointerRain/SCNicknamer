# SC Nicknamer
Styles in game nicknames and name colours with a public json file.
This allows everyone to see the same nicknames and colours in game.

**Note: This was created for Mumbo Jumbo's Minecraft Server though you can use it on your server as well!
This is not official, nor required for Spooncraft.**

**Note: To use this mod on your server, someone will need to host a json file with the data.**

## Features
SC Nicknamer displays the preset nickname and colours of names in game.<br>
It replaces Minecraft names with preset nicknames and colours in the server tablist, player nametags, and chat messages.

## Configuration
With [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), you can enable and disable replacing and colouring names in each location (tablist, nametags, and chat).<br>
You can also change the location from where the data is sourced. This allows you to use it on your own servers. An example of the data format can be seen [here](https://www.jsonkeeper.com/b/R4DQ).

## Disclaimer
This mod was created for Java >1.21.x client-side Fabric.
I will not make a version for Bedrock, Forge, or versions before 1.21.
I may make a server-side version in future depending on demand.<p>
This mod is created primarily for the [Mumbo Jumbo Spooncraft Server](https://discord.gg/mumbo-jumbo-server-377946908783673344), however, it will work for other servers provided you have a json file hosted somewhere.
